 <h1>What is Blackhat Hacking?</h1>
 <p class="h1p">If you watch the news and keep up with technology, you know what a hacker is, but you may not realize hackers fall into different categories known as Black Hat, White Hat, and Gray Hat. The terms derive from the color coding scheme found in 1950s westerns, where the bad guys wore black hats, and the good guys wore white or other light colors.

  Black Hat hackers are criminals who break into computer networks with malicious intent. They may also release malware that destroys files, holds computers hostage, or steals passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information.
  
  While hacking might have become a major intelligence gathering tool for governments, it's still more common for Black Hats to work alone or with organized crime organizations for easy money. The WannaCry ransomware released in May 2017 is one example. Within the first two weeks of its release, it infected approximately 400,000 computers in 150 countries. Fortunately, security experts released decryption tools within days of WannaCry's appearance, and their fast response time limited extortion payments to about $120,000 â€” slightly more than 1 percent of the potential haul.</p>
  <h2>History</h2>
  <ol>
    <p class="hp"> Here's a brief overview of the history of blackhat hacking:</p>
    <li>Early Phases (1960s-1970s):
      In the early days of computing, hacking was primarily seen as a playful exploration of computer systems. The term "hacker" had a positive connotation and referred to individuals who were skilled at programming and computer tinkering. However, some hackers started to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems for personal gain or simply to prove their skills. Notable figures from this era include Kevin Mitnick and Captain Crunch.</li>
      <li>Phone Phreaking (1970s):
        Phone phreaking involved manipulating the telephone network to make free long-distance calls or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Hackers like John Draper (Captain Crunch) and Steve Wozniak gained fame during this period for their exploits, which involved using toy whistles found in cereal boxes to manipulate the telephone system.</li>
        <li>The Rise of the Internet (1980s-1990s):
          As the internet became more accessible, hackers began to exploit vulnerabilities in computer networks and systems. The release of personal computers and the advent of bulletin board systems (BBS) provided a platform for hackers to exchange information and share hacking techniques. In this era, Kevin Mitnick gained notoriety for his high-profile hacking exploits.</li>
          <li>he Hacker Culture (1980s-1990s):
            The hacker culture started to emerge during this period, characterized by a fascination with technology, the pursuit of knowledge, and the exploration of computer systems. Hacking groups like the Chaos Computer Club in Germany and the Legion of Doom in the United States played a significant role in shaping this culture.</li>
           <li>Criminal Hacking (1990s-present):
            The 1990s saw a shift in hacking motivations, with some hackers transitioning from curiosity and mischief to criminal activities. The rise of computer viruses, worms, and other forms of malware became prevalent during this time. Notorious hackers, such as Adrian Lamo and Kevin Poulsen, gained attention for their illegal activities.</li>
            <li>Cybercrime and Nation-State Actors (2000s-present):
              With the increasing dependence on computer systems and the growth of the internet, cybercrime became a major concern. Organized criminal groups started employing hacking techniques to steal sensitive information, commit fraud, or launch targeted attacks. Additionally, nation-state actors began conducting cyber espionage and cyber warfare operations. Notable examples include state-sponsored attacks like Stuxnet and the Sony Pictures hack. </li>
