   <h1>What is Whitehat Hacker?</h1>
   <p class="h1p">A white hat hacker -- or ethical hacker -- is an individual who uses hacking skills to identify security vulnerabilities in hardware, software or networks. However, unlike black hat hackers -- or malicious hackers -- white hat hackers respect the rule of law as it applies to hacking. Many white hat hackers are former black hat hackers. The terms come from old Western movies, where heroes often wore white hats and the bad guys wore black hats.

White hat hackers only seek vulnerabilities or exploits when they are legally permitted to do so. White hat hackers may do their research on open source software, as well as on software or systems they own or have been authorized to investigate, including products and services that operate bug bounty programs. These types of programs reward individuals with money for disclosing security flaws.

Unlike black or gray hat hackers, white hat hackers fully disclose all the vulnerabilities they find to the company or product owner who is responsible for fixing the flaws so the issues can be resolved before they are exploited by malicious hackers.

<h2>History</h2>
<ol>
  <p class="hp">Here's a brief overview of the history of white hat hacking:</p>
  <li>Early Security Pioneers (1960s-1970s):
    As computers started to become more prevalent, some individuals recognized the need for security measures to protect them. These early pioneers, such as James Anderson and Willis Ware, laid the foundation for computer security and ethical hacking by studying vulnerabilities and proposing solutions to protect computer systems.</li>
    <li>The Hacker Culture and Phreaking (1970s-1980s):
      During the emergence of the hacker culture in the 1970s and 1980s, some individuals recognized the importance of using their skills for positive purposes. They formed groups like the Homebrew Computer Club and the Chaos Computer Club, focusing on knowledge sharing and advocating for ethical hacking practices. Many early white hat hackers were also involved in phone phreaking, exploring and securing telephone networks.</li>
     <li>Security Professionals and the Birth of Ethical Hacking (1980s-1990s):
      The 1980s and 1990s saw the rise of security professionals who actively worked on securing computer systems. They began to distinguish themselves from malicious hackers by promoting responsible and legal hacking practices. The term "ethical hacker" was coined to describe individuals who used their skills to identify vulnerabilities and help organizations improve their security posture.</li>
      <li>Legalization of Hacking Activities (1990s-present):
        In the 1990s, some countries recognized the importance of ethical hacking and introduced legislation that allowed security researchers to legally assess systems for vulnerabilities. The United States, for example, passed the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in 1986, which included provisions to exempt authorized hacking activities for security purposes. This legal framework provided a platform for the growth of white hat hacking as a legitimate profession.</li>
      <li>Professionalization and Certifications (2000s-present):
        As the field of ethical hacking continued to evolve, professional organizations and certifications emerged to standardize and validate the skills of ethical hackers. The EC-Council's Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification, introduced in 2003, became widely recognized as a benchmark for ethical hacking skills. Other certifications, such as Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), and Certified Information Security Manager (CISM), also gained prominence.</li>
       <li>Bug Bounty Programs and Collaboration (2010s-present):
        In recent years, the concept of bug bounty programs has gained popularity. These programs allow organizations to crowdsource vulnerability discovery by offering rewards to individuals who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. This approach encourages collaboration between security researchers and organizations, enabling proactive identification and remediation of vulnerabilities.</li>
        <p>Today, ethical hackers play a vital role in improving cybersecurity by identifying weaknesses and helping organizations bolster their defenses. Their work is crucial in an increasingly digital and interconnected world, where the threat of cyber attacks continues to grow.</p>
